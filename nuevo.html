                <p id="p2">"I was an EMT for many wears before fioined the bootcamp. I´ve been looking to make a<br> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fum! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br> weeks wasthe best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <p id="p2">"Before joining the bootcamp, i've<br>
              never written a line of code. I needed<br>
              some structure from professionals<br>
              who can help me learn programming<br>
              step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
              enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
              who can only sav wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff did not<br>
              disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>
              and t never had to wait long for<br>
              assistance. The agile team project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learming to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>
              fact. l'we aften referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br>
              developent experience. It certainly<br>
              helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
